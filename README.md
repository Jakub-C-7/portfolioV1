# Portfolio Version 1
Welcome to my first ever personal portfolio. This portfolio has been superceeded by my portfolioV2!

You can still see portfolioV1 live at: https://aesthetic-cajeta-4c9e6e.netlify.app/

My website is a single-page personal portfolio and is organised into the following
four sections: about me, projects, skills, and contact me.

The website's primary target audience is future recruiters and anyone else who
wants to find out more about me. The website starts with the 'about me' section
which includes a brief summary about me, my social links, and a timeline of key
employment and education. Next is the 'projects' section which is connected to
the GitHub API to retrieve my GitHub profile and repository data. The 'projects'
section also includes pagination of projects on smaller screens which can be traversed
using the arrow buttons. Next is the 'skills' section which is populated with some
of my main technical skills and their related images. Finally, is the 'contact me'
section which includes a validated form which upon completion opens up the user's
email client and populates an email message with my email as the destination,
subject as the user's input subject, and message content as the user's input
message.
